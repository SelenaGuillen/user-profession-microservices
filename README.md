# Final Thoughts
###### What did you think of the project?
I thought this project was a great chance to show what I know, as well as to define what needs more improvement on my end. For example, I think I have a clear understanding about how data is read between the client and server and how to display and manipulate it, but I do need more practice with UI tools.
I also wrote the SQL script to make the table for the testing enviornment and implemented some simple unit tests using JUnit. For CRUD, JPA was used to implement its repositories for easy access to its already defined operations. 
During training, I worked with pure JDBC Template, so getting to play around with JPA was really fun! Another skill I picked up in training was using Thymeleaf to access Java data via templates. The templates themselves were styled with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
One of my favorite parts was definitely getting to work with AWS. I ended up using the root account to create an IAM User specifically for this project with the necessary permissions. That IAM user was used to deploy AWS Elastic Beanstalk and to configure security group settings for the RDS so I could connect to it (and populate it) with MySQL.
###### What didnâ€™t you like about the project?
There isn't anything I disliked. I do think the instructions could have been clearer, and in the workplace, I would definitely ask for specification on some of the requirements,
but overall, I did like that it was open-ended enough to the point where I could explore the possibilities on my own and to come up with what I have. I had wanted to experiment with AWS for a while so this was a great opportunity to just that. I selected Spring Boot MVC and Java because those are what I'm most familiar with at the moment. For future UI implementations, I would definitely love to try out React again!
###### Anything else you would like to share?
I actually had a lot of fun working on this! I know there is still a lot to improve on, but I am willing to put in the time and effort to ensure that I follow the best practices and to become great at what I do.
